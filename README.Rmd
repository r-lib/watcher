Watch the File System for Changes

R binding for 'libfswatch', a file system monitoring library. This uses the optimal event-driven API for each platform:

- `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows
- `FSEvents` on MacOS
- `inotify` on Linux
- `kqueue` on BSD
- `File Events Notification` on Solaris/Illumos

Watching is done asynchronously in the background, without blocking the session.

- Watch files, or directories recursively.
- Log activity, or run an R function every time a change event occurs.

## Installation

Install the current development version of watcher using:

``` r
pak::pak("r-lib/watcher")
```

#### Installation from Source

watcher requires the 'libfswatch' library.

- On Linux / MacOS, an installed version will be used if found in the standard filesystem locations.
- On Windows, or if not found, the bundled version of 'libfswatch' 1.19.0-dev will be compiled from source.
- Source compilation of the library requires 'cmake'.

## Quick Start

Create a 'Watcher' using `watcher::watcher()`.

By default this will watch the current working directory recursively and write events to `stdout`.

Set the `callback` argument to run an R function, or rlang-style formula, every time a file changes:

- Uses the 'later' package to execute the callback when R is idle at the top level, or whenever `later::run_now()` is called, for instance automatically in Shiny's event loop.
- Function is called back with a character vector of the paths of all files which have changed.

```{r example}
library(watcher)
dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "watcher-example")
dir.create(dir)

w <- watcher(dir, callback = ~print(.x), latency = 0.5)
w
w$start()

file.create(file.path(dir, "newfile"))
file.create(file.path(dir, "anotherfile"))
later::run_now(1)

newfile <- file(file.path(dir, "newfile"), open = "r+")
cat("hello", file = newfile)
close(newfile)
later::run_now(1)

file.remove(file.path(dir, "newfile"))
later::run_now(1)

w$stop()
unlink(dir, recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```
