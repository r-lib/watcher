Watch the File System for Changes

R binding for 'libfswatch', a file system monitoring library. This uses the optimal event-driven API for each platform: `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows, `FSEvents` on MacOS, `inotify` on Linux, `kqueue` on BSD, and `File Events Notification` on Solaris/Illumos.

Watching is done asynchronously in the background, without blocking the session.

- Watch files, or directories recursively.
- Log activity, or trigger an R function to run every time an event occurs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of watcher from:

``` r
pak::pak("shikokuchuo/watcher")
```

## Example

Create a 'Watcher' using `watcher::watcher()`.

By default this will watch the current working directory recursively and write events to `stdout`.

Set the `callback` argument to run an arbitrary R function, or `rlang`-style formula, every time a file changes:

- Uses the `later` package to execute the callback when R is idle at the top level, or
- Whenever `later::run_now()` is called, for instance automatically in Shiny's event loop.

```{r example}
library(watcher)
dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "watcher-example")
dir.create(dir)

w <- watcher(dir, callback = ~print("event triggered"), latency = 0.1)
w
w$start()

Sys.sleep(0.1)
file.create(file.path(dir, "oldfile"))
later::run_now(0.1)

file.rename(file.path(dir, "oldfile"), file.path(dir, "newfile"))
later::run_now(0.1)

file.remove(file.path(dir, "newfile"))
later::run_now(0.1)

w$stop()
unlink(dir, recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```
